At present, mobile phones are widely used for both personal and business purposes. 

Spam is a generic term for unsolicited messages sent via electronic communication technologies such as SMS, MMS, instant messaging (IM), and email. 

Mobile phone spam, also known as SMS spam, text spam, or m-spam, refers to unsolicited messages sent in bulk form to known/unknown phone numbers/email IDs to target mobile phones. 

Typical spam messages delivered to mobile phones are as follows: 
▪ Messages containing advertisements or malicious links that can trick users into revealing confidential information

▪ Attractive commercial messages advertising products/services 

▪ SMS or MMS messages claiming that the victim has won a prize and asking him/her to place a call to a provided premium-rate telephone service number for further details

▪ Malicious links that may lure users into divulging sensitive personal or corporate data 

▪ Phishing messages that lure the recipient into revealing personal or financial data such as name, address, date of birth, bank account number, credit card number, and so on, which an attacker can use to commit identity or financial fraud
