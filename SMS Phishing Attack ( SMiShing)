Text messaging is the most prevalent nonvoice communication on mobile phones. Users around the world send and receive billions of text messages daily. 

Such a massive amount of data entails an increase in spam or phishing attacks. 

SMS phishing (also known as SMiShing) is a type of phishing fraud in which an attacker uses SMS systems to send bogus text messages.

It is the act of trying to acquire personal and financial information by sending SMS (or IM) containing deceptive links.

Often, these bogus text messages contain a deceptive website URL or telephone number to lure victims into revealing their personal or financial information, such as SSNs, credit card numbers, and online banking username and password.

In addition, attackers implement SMiShing to infect victims’ mobile phones and associated networks with malware. Attackers buy a prepaid SMS card using a fake identity. 

Then, they send an SMS bait to a user. The SMS may seem attractive or urgent. For example, it may include a lottery message, gift voucher, online purchase, or notification of account suspension, along with a malicious link or phone number. 

When the user clicks the link, considering it to be legitimate, he/she is redirected to the attacker’s phishing site, where he/she provides the requested information (e.g., name, phone number, date of birth, credit card number or PIN, CVV code, SNN, and email address). 

The attacker may use the acquired information to perform malicious activities such as identity theft, online purchases, and so on

SMS phishing is an effective attack method for several reasons: 
▪ High open rates: SMS messages have significantly higher opening rates than email messages. 
Most people tend to open and read text messages almost immediately, which makes it easier for attackers to reach their targets.

▪ Trust in SMS: Many people trust SMS more than email, often considering it as a more personal and direct form of communication.
Trust can lead to lower levels of skepticism when receiving messages.

▪ Limited space for links and content: SMS messages have character limitations that force attackers to create concise and compelling messages. 
This can make it more difficult for recipients to spot telltale signs of phishing, which are more apparent in longer emails.

▪ Lack of security awareness: Users are generally less aware of the potential risks associated with SMS than email. 
Many are familiar with email phishing tactics but are less knowledgeable about smishing.

▪ Mobile device usage: Mobile devices are often less protected than desktop computers. 
Many users do not have robust security software installed on their smartphones, which makes them more vulnerable to attacks.
