Smartphones are increasingly attracting the attention of cyber criminals. 

Mobile app developers must understand the threat to the security and privacy of mobile devices by running a non-sandboxed app, and they should develop sandboxed apps accordingly.

App sandboxing is a security mechanism that helps protect systems and users by limiting the resources that an app can access to its intended functionality on the mobile platform.

Often, sandboxing is useful in executing untested code or untrusted programs from unverified or untrusted third parties, suppliers, users, and websites. 

This enhances security by isolating the app to prevent intruders, system resources, malware such as Trojans and viruses, and other apps from interacting with it. 

As sandboxing isolates applications from one another, it protects them from tampering with each other; however, malicious applications may exploit vulnerabilities and bypass the sandbox. 

A secure sandbox environment provides an application with limited privileges intended for its functionality to restrict it from accessing other usersâ€™ data and system resources, whereas a vulnerable sandbox environment allows a malicious application to exploit vulnerabilities in the sandbox and breach its perimeter, resulting in the exploitation of other data and system resources.
