Call spoofing is a technique used by attackers to manipulate the caller ID information displayed on a recipient's phone when they receive a call. 

Attackers use this technique to disguise their phone number as a trusted source, such as a bank or government agency, trick individuals into sharing sensitive information, or pay for unnecessary services. 

Attackers also leverage this technique to make threatening or harassing phone calls, while concealing their identities

The various tools that an attacker can use to perform call spoofing against a targeted phone number are discussed below:

â–ª SpoofCard 
SpoofCard allows attackers to use a virtual number to make calls and send text while concealing personal information regardless of location. 

Attackers can use this tool to change their voices during calls to sound like those of a different gender and add background noise. 

Additionally, it enables attackers to send calls directly to voicemail and record conversations for later reviews or uploads to cloud services, such as Google Drive and Dropbox.
