The goal of rooting Android is to overcome the restrictions imposed by hardware manufacturers and carriers, 

thereby resulting in the ability to modify or replace system applications and settings, run apps that require admin privileges, remove and replace a device’s OS, remove applications pre-installed by its manufacturer or carrier, or perform other operations that are otherwise inaccessible to the typical Android user. 

Rooting allows Android users to attain privileged control (known as “root access”) within Android’s subsystem. 

The rooting process involves exploiting security vulnerabilities in the device’s firmware, copying the su binary to a location in the current process’s PATH (e.g., /system/xbin/su), and granting it executable permissions with the chmod command.

▪ Modifying or deleting system files, modules, ROMs (stock firmware), and kernels 

▪ Removing carrier-or manufacturer-installed applications (bloatware) 

▪ Low-level access to hardware that is typically unavailable to devices in their default configuration
▪ Improved performance 

▪ Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tethering 

▪ Installing applications on SD card 

▪ Better user interface and keyboard
